# Project Archives (AKA "The Vault")

This organization serves as an archive of my old projects,
with commit history preserved.

This needs to exist because I frequently start projects but don't always finish them.
There are many reasons I may not finish projects, but the most common ones are:

- I have decided to move on to learning new skills
- I found competitive software that works better
- The project is not worth the forecasted effort
- The project is technologically impractical
- The project is not important to anyone besides myself
- I have lost interest
- It was only a proof-of-concept to begin with
- Any combination of the above

Some of these projects may eventually be revived in the future either
as a fork or in the form of a complete re-write.

Please feel free to continue working on them (via forking) or use them
as reference for your own works.
